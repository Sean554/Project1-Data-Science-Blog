## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
The aim and motivation behind this project was to explore the Air BnB data from Seattle and Boston in order to gain insight into some questions such as:

Is the price of accomodation in Seattle influenced by the month of the year?
Is there varying characteristics depending on whether the Air Bnb host is a superhost or just a regular host?
What were the key factors contributing to the price of accomodation for Seattle/Boston Air Bnbs?
