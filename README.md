## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
The aim and motivation behind this project was to explore the Airbnb data from Seattle and Boston in order to gain insight into some questions such as:

Does the price of Airbnb accommodation in Seattle vary much depending on the month?Â 
Are there any significant differences in terms of the reviews an Airbnb Superhost will receive compared to a regular host?
Are Superhosts more effective at responding and engaging with their customers than regular hosts?
Can we use the the Seattle & Boston Airbnb data to predict price? If so, what are the most important factors when determining price of accommodation?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are 3 notebooks available related to the questions above. The 'Q1' notebook answers the first question, the 'Q2' notebook answers questions 2 and 3 and the 'Q3' notebook relates to question 4. These notebooks explore a range of Airbnb data and provide insights and answers to the questions posed. Comments and markdown cells were used throughout the notebooks to explain the steps taken.

The Seattle and Boston datasets from Kaggle are also available to view here.
